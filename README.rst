Optimization for MBJ Analyses
=============================

Hello! The point of this repository is to centralize all of the information needed to handle optimization for the MultiB Jet Analysis for ATLAS. This makes it easier to keep all of our information in one place for referencing.

The `.gitignore <.gitignore>`_ file will ignore the default directories made as a result of running the ``optimize.py`` script. It is suggested to only put in the bare minimum files needed to recreate or rerun a set of optimizations to produce plots. This way, you still need the appropriate files to do anything.
