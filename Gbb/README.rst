Gbb Optimizations
=================

See `run.sh <run.sh>`_ for example scripts on how I run the code. In general, these are run on hadd'd histfitter outputs from MBJ.

- we could reduce the MET extrapolation in region 2, if you feel it's too much (200 GeV) by going to 100 GeV, and adding a meff extrapolation too but the tradeoff is extrapolating 3 variables.
